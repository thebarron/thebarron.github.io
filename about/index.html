  <h1>About Nohm</h1>
  <p>
    Nohm is accelerating the shift to a sustainable transportation grid - one that moves people and products without sacrificing economics or well-being. Nohm manufactures and sells the first ground-up designed suite of commercial, class 4-5 and 6-7 Medium Duty Electric Vehicles (MDEVs), with 100+ mile range, economic parity with fuel vehicles, and grid integration readiness that meets urban requirements and creates new clean energy value streams. Nohmâ€™s E-Trucks, E-Buses, and E-Vans can be adapted across a wide range of use cases, from shuttle bus to luxury transport to goods and parcel delivery. Based in Burlingame, California, Nohm was founded in 2015 with investment from publicly traded FDG Group (0729.HK). FDG Group is a fully integrated vehicle OEM that develops and commercializes a portfolio of ground-up designed, all-electric vehicles that meet the performance, safety and cost requirements of global markets. FDG operates a 3.8 million square foot, state of the art manufacturing facility in Hangzhou, China, which has the capacity of manufacturing 100,000 electric vehicles per year. Nohm is initially importing incomplete vehicles from FDG, with final assembly to be completed in California, and plans to establish manufacturing in the United States to create new US jobs and support scaled demand.
