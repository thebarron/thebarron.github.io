  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    Nohm’s purpose is to Change the Energy. Our work starts with changing fuel energy – replacing fossil fuels with renewable electricity. But “Nohmies” are driven by a much bigger purpose; one we’re already well in process of achieving. Nohm’s much larger passion is to elevate human energy everywhere. We do this by becoming an outlet for positive intention. The change to electrification – the actual process of shifting away from squeezing the earth to sourcing the sun – energizes people’s spirits and work.
    <br><br>
    Consider the truck driver whose world changes after climbing into an all-electric truck.  From day one, the same job carries new impact as literally tons of emissions are reduced. This impact radiates across organizations and communities as people are energized by the “profit, people, and planet” advantages inherent with vehicle electrification. 
    <br><br>
    We invite you to dig deep into the content on our site to discover how many ways Nohm EVs outperform society’s fossil fuel foes. We hope you’ll hop in and ride along. Please sign on for our weekly information energy boosts and let us know how Nohm’s vision energizes you.
