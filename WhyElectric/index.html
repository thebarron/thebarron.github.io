  <h1>Why Electric?</h1>
  <p>
    Medium Duty Electric Vehicles are a niche within the transportation sector that
    possess potential to create monumental impact within our urban environments.

    Urban areas cover 2% of the earthâ€™s surface, but are responsible for over
    70% greenhouse gas emissions.

    These vehicles are an integral part of our daily lives.

    Constantly running all day, MDEVs release approximately 23 lbs of
    [carbon/pollution] emissions - the weight of a car tire - for every one gallon
    of fuel used.

  <h2>Estimated Fleet Vehicles per City<h2>

    The result of 100,000s of gallons of fuel times 100,000s of vehicles per city
    is endless polution.

    This continual workload means that for every diesel truck that is replaced with
    electric, the impact is equivalent to removing 7.2 gas-fueled cars.<br><br>
    Electrification of these fleets translates into huge environmental and fiscal
    savings.
